# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis implementation using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The code was developed in Jupyter Notebook and can classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on a dataset.

## Features

- **Training**: Uses labeled data to train the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Prediction**: Classifies user-provided text.
- **Evaluation**: Includes metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   cd <repository-name>

<br>
Data Collection: Gather a dataset comprising user reviews and corresponding star ratings from a Course seeling website.<br>
<br>
Text Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, handling punctuation, and transforming text into numerical features.<br>
<br>
Naive Bayes Model: Implement a Naive Bayes classifier to predict star ratings from the processed text data.<br>
<br>
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
<br>
Interactive Jupyter Notebook: The entire analysis and model building process are documented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.<br>
