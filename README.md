# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting star ratings based on textual comment reviews. The implementation utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, a powerful technique for text classification, to analyze sentiments and assign star ratings to user comments.<br>
<br>
Data Collection: Gather a dataset comprising user reviews and corresponding star ratings from a Course seeling website.<br>
<br>
Text Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, handling punctuation, and transforming text into numerical features.<br>
<br>
Naive Bayes Model: Implement a Naive Bayes classifier to predict star ratings from the processed text data.<br>
<br>
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
<br>
Interactive Jupyter Notebook: The entire analysis and model building process are documented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.<br>
